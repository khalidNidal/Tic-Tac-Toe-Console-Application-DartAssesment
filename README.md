## **Rules**

- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their shapes ('X' or 'O') on the board.
- To make a move, enter a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to the section on the board.
- The game will check for a win condition after each move.
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
- If all sections are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
- The game prompts each player to enter their move in turn.
